# Interlinks Extension For Quarto

This filter is provides the same functionality as the official
[interlinks](https://github.com/machow/quartodoc/tree/main/_extensions/interlinks)
filter that is documented
[here](https://machow.github.io/quartodoc/get-started/interlinks.html).

It is optimised to cope a little better with large inventory files.

## Installing

```bash
quarto add has2k1/interlinks
```

This will install the extension under the `_extensions` subdirectory.
If you're using version control, you will want to check in this directory.
